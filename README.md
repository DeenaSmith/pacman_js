This fast-paced game is based on the classis Pacman arcade game and was built using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. The player can use the traditional 
WASD (up, left, down, right) buttons on their keyboard for movement across the map to eat pellets, avoid ghosts, and eat ghosts while powered up. Click
